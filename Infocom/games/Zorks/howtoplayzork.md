# This is a note on how to play Zork I, Zork II, & Zork III
Given that these are old games formated as MAC binaries and compressed, you have to download frotz and uudeview to play.
sudo apt-get install frotz uudeview
The program uudeview uncompressed the game file while frotz lets you play the game.

First, download the MAC binaries and place them in a directory.

Second, uncompress the games using uudeview, uudeview -i zorki.hqx.

Third, play by running frotz, frotz ZORKI.
