This bundle contains multiple folders for different versions of CircuitPython. You must use the files that match the version of CircuitPython you're currently using. For example, if you are using CircuitPython X.x, copy the files from the corresponding CircuitPython X.x folder to your CIRCUITPY drive.
To use this project bundle, simply copy the contents of the CircuitPython version folder you're using from the zip file to your CIRCUITPY drive.
Contents in each version include:
* the code.py file
* the lib/ folder and all of its contents (including subfolders and .mpy or .py files)
* any assets (such as images, sounds, etc.)
NOTE: This will replace the current code.py, and the lib folder and its contents. Back up any desired code before copying these files!
